Based on your provided test data, the objective is to determine the optimal transportation plan to meet the demands of various users from different warehouses while minimizing transportation costs. Here's an interpretation of the data:

- There are four users and four warehouses.
- Each user has a demand for a specific product: User 1 wants 50kg of Apples, User 2 wants 60kg of Bananas, User 3 wants 70 liters of Water, and User 4 wants 80 liters of Juice.
- Warehouses have the following stock: Warehouse 1 has 1000kg of Apples, Warehouse 2 has 1000kg of Bananas, Warehouse 3 has 2000 liters of Water, and Warehouse 4 has 2000 liters of Juice.
- Each warehouse has a coverage range of 100 units.
- Each warehouse has a transportation option that can deliver a certain quantity of its product: Warehouse 1 can deliver 100kg of Apples, Warehouse 2 can deliver 200kg of Bananas, Warehouse 3 can deliver 300 liters of Water, and Warehouse 4 can deliver 400 liters of Juice.
- Each transportation option has a cost associated with it, expressed in terms of time. The cost is the same for all transportation options: 60 units.

Given these conditions, a simple solution that does not necessarily minimize cost but meets all requirements could be:

- Use the transportation option from Warehouse 1 to deliver 50kg of Apples to User 1.
- Use the transportation option from Warehouse 2 to deliver 60kg of Bananas to User 2.
- Use the transportation option from Warehouse 3 to deliver 70 liters of Water to User 3.
- Use the transportation option from Warehouse 4 to deliver 80 liters of Juice to User 4.

This solution assumes that the warehouses are within the coverage range of the respective users and that the transportation options can deliver the required quantity of goods. The cost of this solution would be 4*60 = 240 units.

However, to truly minimize cost, you would need to consider other factors such as the geographical distribution of the users and the warehouses, and whether it would be more cost-effective to use a single transportation option multiple times or to use different transportation options. The best solution would be obtained by running the optimization algorithm with this data.
